        <h2>This page is appealing because...</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The overall design perfectly encapsulates the purpose in which it is made for. It also looks nice!</li>
            <li>It is highly interactive and innovative the way they allow a player to scan a code to use their phones as a game pad.</li>
            <li>They have a wide selection of games!</li>
        </ol>
    </body>
    <p>I would encourage other software developers to visit this website because of how creative and fun it is. 
        It allows the user to have an interactive and immersive experience without taking away from the functionality of the website</p>

        <h2>This page is appealing because...</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>There is no clutter, as you scroll down the website, you'll see a section for each of the lastest products that apple is selling</li>
            <li>The website is intuitive, all of the necessary options are given on the top nav bar. 
                This allows the user to navigate to the desired page faster 
            </li>
            <li>The imagery used for each section correctly reflects apples brand as well as the product that it is trying to showcase. </li>
        </ol>
    </body>
    <p>
        I would definitely recommend others to use this website, either to purchase apple products or to use the website for inspiration 
        to design their own websites. This website doesnt overwhelm the user with too many options while also allowing them access their desired page
        faster via the nav bar.

        <h2>This page is unappealing because...</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>It is far too cluttered, and if you click on the wrong link, you'll have to navigate back to the home page to get to where you need to be. </li>
            <li>It only has text, making use of some imagery or colors could greatly improve the overall look of this website.</li>
            <li>Using broader categories on a nav bar can allow users to navigate throughout the website 
                alot more easily. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        

        <h3>Suggestions for Improvement:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate each different category and have a main page listing those main categories. </li>
            <li>Add more user friendly ui, as in, maybe a main nav bar that can expand when you hover on it and broader sections on the start page with images that reflect.</li>
            <li>Use brand specific colors to maintain the reputation of the brand and allow the page to be more recognizable. </li>
        </ol>
    </body>

    <p>I would not encourage others to visit this website because of the difficulty that comes with trying to maneuver around this website to find what you're looking for. </p>

        <h2>This page is unappealing because...</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Too much information is being shown to you all at once</li>
            <li>It takes a while to load all the different images. 
                In other words, there are too many images trying to catch the users attention</li>
            <li>The front page isnt organized at all, things seem to be listed wherever they fit on the page.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Suggestions for Improvement:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate each of the listed items into broader categories and list them on a navigation bar. </li>
            <li>Add more whitespace when listing each individual purcheasable item to avoid any confusion from the users end. </li>
            <li>Use more uniform spacing when listing each items. Perhaps by using a grid-like format. </li>
        </ol>
    </body>

    <p>I would not recommend using this website because of how confusing the UI design is. It seems as if the listed items were placed 
        with little to no thought into their placement. It seems like they wanted to fit as many things on the main page as possible to allow the 
        user to see as many items as possible.
