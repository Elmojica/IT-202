                The U.S. Postal Service is the only delivery service that reaches every address in the nation: 160 million residences, businesses and Post Office Boxes. 
                The Postal Service receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.

                 operating revenue of more than $71 billion and delivers 48 percent of the world’s mail. With more than 630,000 employees, we are one of the nation’s largest 
                 employers. And we have one of the world’s largest computer networks.
